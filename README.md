To create a README file for the repository `Reddy2605/Image-Quilting`, I will draft a structured template. Since I don't have specific details about the project, I'll create a general framework that you can customize as needed. Hereâ€™s a sample README:

# Image Quilting

## Description
Image Quilting is a project that focuses on texture synthesis and image manipulation. It leverages advanced techniques to create seamless textures or quilted patterns from sample images. The project may have applications in computer graphics, gaming, or artistic design.

## Features
- **Texture Synthesis**: Generate large textures from smaller samples.
- **Quilting Patterns**: Seamlessly stitch image blocks to form cohesive designs.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust block sizes, overlap, and blending options for tailored results.

## Installation
To get started with Image Quilting, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Reddy2605/Image-Quilting.git
cd Image-Quilting
```

### Dependencies
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python (version 3.x)
- Required libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script to generate quilted images:

```bash
python image_quilting.py --input <input_image> --output <output_image> --block-size <size> --overlap <overlap_size>
```

### Parameters
- `--input`: Path to the input image file.
- `--output`: Path to save the generated image.
- `--block-size`: Size of the blocks used for quilting.
- `--overlap`: Size of the overlap between blocks.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the tool:

1. Basic Quilting:
   ```bash
   python image_quilting.py --input sample.jpg --output quilted.jpg --block-size 32 --overlap 16
   ```

2. Advanced Options:
   ```bash
   python image_quilting.py --input texture.jpg --output seamless_texture.jpg --block-size 64 --overlap 32
   ```
